            I start to created Youtube account since April 29, 2017 but active uploading video on this channel in last February, 2020 that was during lockdown. I really like to play online games with my firend, so why not i share to everyone watch my gameplay and having fun. For your information, i also like to editing a video. That my passions. I can spend 3 hours just for editing the video. But i edit video just using mobile editor that is Kine Master Pro that i think can compete with software editor such as adobe premiere.
